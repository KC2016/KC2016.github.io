									<p>The quarantine was, and still is being, such a productive period for me. When the lockdown started in Germany, 
                                        that was 16th March, I was jumping in chatbots, starting to collaborate with an open-source project for the first time. 
                                        At this point, I was writing the application for a summer of code internship and looking for coaches with experience in 
                                        Machine Learning and chatbots, since I had chosen an interesting project with Machine Learning to cooperate with. 
                                        Meanwhile, I was installing the tools, packages, and environments to work on it, and that's when I realized that 
                                        I would have trouble working with Machine Learning using my machine.<br/>

                                        My beloved and battered notebook, which has accompanied me since my doctorate, where I wrote my thesis and my articles 
                                        (those published and those rejected as well), was no longer meeting the demand now that I am migrating to Data Science. 
                                        I needed to get a proper environment, which after a long journey with many frustrating attempts, I discovered that my 
                                        notebook could not provide me. My computer wouldn't let me activate a virtual machine and I had a lot of bugs when 
                                        running the Machine Learning environments. So, I had to retire my notebook and get another machine to work.<br/>
                                        
                                        Since my background is not computer science or computer engineering, I had difficult to deal with a lot of new stuff. 
                                        Also, I had to go deeper in others stuff that I have studied in my career-change trajectory, but I hadn't applied enough 
                                        to learn well. Hence, I learned and used Windows subsystem Linux, Mac, Anaconda, contributing with forked projects, 
                                        scrapy with Python, GitHub pages, Visual Studio code, etc. After solving the “environment” issue, I started refreshing 
                                        my memory about Machine Learning from theory to application. There is a wide range of great courses and workshops 
                                        available on the internet free of charge, during this period. That’s awesome! Also, I jumped into the chatbots in 
                                        leaning Dialogflow and NLU-Rasa.<br/>
                                        
                                        I was not chosen to receive the scholarship and did not receive any feedback about it, which was somewhat frustrating. 
                                        But working on the project (and preparing for it) has been a great learning experience. I think working on open-source 
                                        projects is an excellent way to learn tools and workflow. Each learning experience was a celebrated achievement that has 
                                        given me confidence in working in technology. I, who am passionate about working with data and love to learn, are now 
                                        even more motivated to continue my journey seeking out to enter in a tech company at a Data Scientist position.<br/>
